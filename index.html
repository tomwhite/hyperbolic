		<h2>Abstract</h2>
		
		<p>
		This page is devoted to a discussion of the benefits hyperbolic displays can
		bring to visualisation of large datasets. I have provided some Java Applets to
		demonstrate some of the ideas.
		</p>

		<h2>Hyperbolic Geometry in Computer Displays</h2>
		
		<p>
		Although steadily becoming cheaper screen 'real estate' is still at a premium. Computer
		applications developers strain to squeeze as much information as possible from each patch
		of pixels while monitor manufacturers grow their models inexorably - but slowly. Until we
		have wall-sized display units that allow us to shuffle views as flexibly as we hang
		pictures now we shall continue to use nifty space-saving measures such as scrolling
		panels and switchable windows.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		It may then come as a surprise that - in the world of pure mathematics at least - an
		<i>infinite amount</i> of space can be contained in a finite area. The trick of course is
		that the visible size of objects in such a space, called a <i>hyperbolic geometry</i>,
		decreases to nothing as you get closer to the 'edge'. To illustrate this we can use the
		Poincare/ Model which is one such hyperbolic geometry. This model represents a
		point in hyperbolic space by a point on the unit disk - that is, the numbers in the
		complex plane with magnitude less than 1. Distances in this disk are not measured using
		the familiar Euclidean metric, but rather one which attributes the distance to the edge of
		the disk as <i>infinity</i>. This means that the whole Euclidean plane is 'contained' in
		the unit disk. The only problem is the edge is a little squashed.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Nice things about this new view:
		<ul>
		<li>
		There is no artificial cut-off. In the scrollbar model there is a fixed rectangular
		area which acts as an arbitrarily sized clipping area. And the size of this area is often
		dictated by external concerns, such as the left over space in a given window. The
		scrollbars are imposed for practical reasons - not because they are an integral part of
		the view. The hyperbolic view has no such unnatural constructs.
		</li>
		<li>
		Cut-off is not sharp. You do not know what is just beyond the scrollbar. In a hyperbolic
		view, you have at least some visual indication - a <i>gestalt</i> - of what is coming up. This
		hyperbolic method thus lends itself well to applications where there is some form of
		connectivity between regions of space, such as maps. Applications with unordered, linear,
		or text only elements don't benefit as well from a hyperbolic projection; list boxes for
		example.
		</li>
		<li>
		The view can fit in any fixed display space. Infinite Euclidean space - the usual
		(unstated) display model - can be wrapped in a disk of arbitrary size. Although only the
		central portion, roughly three-quarters of the display area of the disk, is clearly
		discernible - in a sense the view takes in the whole object. The display can mask the
		size of the object (although this can be a disadvantage) which brings a certain elegant
		simplicity.
		</li>
		<li>
		Natural rotation. In scroll panel implementations there is no obvious mechanism for
		rotation, and if there is then the height and width of the display object changes which
		can be disconcerting or annoying. Since the hyperbolic view disguises absolute size and
		since the display is a circular presentation, rotation is an entirely natural motion.
		</li>
		<li>
		Controls neatly occupy the space around the disk. 
		</li>
		</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
		But:
		<ul>
		<li>
		There is no indication of how big the display object is. There is no 'width of scrollbar
		thumb' equivalent measure.
		</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
	
		<p>
		Promising applications include:
		<ul>
		<li>
		Maps, both geographic and topological. With clear directional markings navigation - by
		dragging and rotation, or programmatically - is very intuitive. Indeed, 'fly by wire'
		views appear very promising and could find interesting application in car navigation
		units (where the driver needs a large magnified view of his or her current location and
		but only an indication of the geography much further ahead).
		</li>
		<li>
		Hierarchies such as trees and graphs. See paper on displaying the WWW in hyperbolic space.
		</li>
		<li>
		Tiling of the plane. Since you can 'scroll forever' a nice application would visualising
		an infinite tiling such as wallpaper (periodic) or a Penrose tiling (aperiodic).
		See the <a href="../alhambra/index.html">alhambra project</a> for more on aperiodic tilings.
		</li>
		</ul>
